# An Introduction to GitHub

Being able to comfortably use GitHub (or another VCS) is something no developer can live without today. GitHub is essential for code collaboration and even otherwise, is very useful! It helps you in a lot of different ways. How awesome would it be if someone asks you for proof of work and you can just share a URL with them that has all your code, documented and easily accessible?

To understand what GitHub is, we need to understand what Git is. It's an open source Version Control System that was thought of and developed by Linus Torvalds (yes, the Linux guy). There are other VCS platforms available but Git seems to be the widely used one. 

## Version Control System?

When you're coding something, you'll be coming up with an initial working framework and then slowly adding bits and pieces to ensure that the project is always at a working state, and that any unwanted changes can be removed easily. 

In this process, it is very useful if there exists a way to keep track of all the new features that are being added, and to be able to *revert* to an older version when something goes wrong. This is where git comes in. 

It enables code collaboration, since all edits can be periodically sent to a central server from where anyone can update at any time, meaning that even though multiple people might be working on the same project at the same time, they're all working on the same file. 

Also, it allows easy distribution of the code. Once you're done coding, all you need to do to let other people all over the world use your code is to upload it on GitHub and give instructions for usage, if any. Done!

## Github?

We’ve established that Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

Not just as a programmer, you can use GitHub to save any file, as long as it fits under Github's size limit! PDFs, word documents, MP3 files, you name it, it can be put in GitHub.

## Organization

Every project / collection of files in GitHub is stored as a **repository**, with it's own special URL. This is where all the code related to your application can be found.
