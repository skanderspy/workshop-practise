## Creating pull requests

Now, we are entering the world of collaboration. When you choose to fork someone's code and you want them to take a look at your changes so they can add it to their code, you do this by creating a pull request. 

Creating a pull request is done completely on the web interface!

- Head over to your copy of this repository, and you will notice that GitHub's telling you that your code is ahead of the source (mine) by x commits. 

- You will also notice a tab in the webpage called 'Pull Requests'. Go to that tab, click on the big green ***New Pull Request***  button. 

- Now, GitHub allows pull requests from both branches and forks. Choose the relevant option here (fork) and click on the ***Create pull request**** button. 

That's it! You've now created a new pull request. Congrats!
