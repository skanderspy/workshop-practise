## Hi there!

Now that you have mastered the basics of GitHub, it's time to test your knowledge and do some self learning! 

Now that we have read up on how to do **pull requests**, we're going to test your knowledge. 

- Fork the following repository to your account: 
[cyberwizard1001.github.io](https://github.com/cyberwizard1001/cyberwizard1001.github.io) 
- Now, clone it to your local system.
- This is a GitHub pages blog (which will be the next part of this test).
- To complete your challenge, modify the file ***index.md*** following the instructions given in the file and then create a pull request.
- If we receive the pull request and you have modified the file as expected, you will be awarded points. 
- Once that's done, head over to [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)! 
- This is your last and final challenge. 
- Create a GitHub pages site for yourself as mentioned in the tutorial, and send us the link through this form:
- https://forms.office.com/r/tt0hsVy2mU
