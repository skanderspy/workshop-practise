# Hello World!

We have discussed the importance of touch typing as part of our workshop  and now, we'd like to share some resources that'll be useful in your path to success in the world of touch typing. Sit back and relax as you finish all your online assessments before everyone else!

**Note:** Practice is very important as far as typing is concerned. The initial stages might be tough, boring and you might not see your typing speed increase all of a sudden, but persevere and you'll see your speeds touch and cross 100 wpm eventually. 15 minutes per day should be enough!
